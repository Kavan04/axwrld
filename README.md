# Axwrld Wiki

## Problem Statement

In an increasingly globalized world, traditional recipes and cultural culinary practices are disappearing. Generational gaps, migration, and the convenience of fast food are causing people to lose touch with authentic, homestyle flavors and the knowledge passed down through families. Many lack access to the ingredients, time, or guidance needed to recreate these treasured dishes.

## Our Solution

axwrld bridges this gap by creating a digital culinary map where users can explore authentic dishes from around the world, along with their cultural backgrounds. It also includes an **AI Chef** that customizes recipes to fit individual dietary needs, empowering users to recreate these traditional recipes with ease.

## What makes it Axwrld Different?

Unlike standard recipe apps, axwrld emphasizes authenticity and cultural context. Each recipe includes insights into the dish’s origins and cultural significance, allowing users to experience the world’s flavors in a way that feels personal and meaningful. The **AI Chef** adds value by tailoring recipes for health-conscious individuals while preserving the dish’s essence.

## How We Made It Possible (Technical Overview)

### Global Recipe Map
The **Global Recipe Map** serves as the backbone of axwrld, enabling users to explore recipes by region, culture, and cuisine. Each recipe is geotagged, allowing users to easily discover dishes based on specific geographic locations. Here’s how it works:
- **Geolocation & Tagging**: Recipes are tagged with geographic metadata that links them to specific locations around the world. Users can also contribute by tagging and uploading their own family recipes, creating a community-driven map that grows over time.
- **Crowdsourced Data**: Users are encouraged to submit and fill in recipes, contributing both ingredients and cooking instructions. Each submission is reviewed for authenticity to maintain the platform's emphasis on cultural accuracy.
- **Map Navigation**: The recipe map uses an interactive, zoomable interface, allowing users to search by region, country, or cuisine type. Filtering options make it easy to find recipes based on dietary needs, ingredient availability, and cooking style.

### AI Chef
The **AI Chef** is an intelligent recipe assistant that personalizes recipes based on users' dietary preferences, ingredient availability, and nutritional needs. Built using machine learning and natural language processing, it enhances the culinary experience by ensuring users can make informed, healthy, and culturally authentic choices.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: NLP allows the AI Chef to interpret user input, such as dietary restrictions (e.g., vegan, gluten-free), available ingredients, or taste preferences. The NLP engine parses this information to suggest suitable recipes or adapt existing ones.
- **Machine Learning Customization**: The AI Chef employs machine learning algorithms to make personalized recommendations, drawing on data from previous user interactions and preferences. Over time, it learns user preferences, improving its suggestions and enhancing user satisfaction.
- **Nutritional Guidance**: Using a built-in nutritional database, the AI Chef analyzes recipes and provides nutritional insights, including calorie counts and macronutrient information. Users receive dietary suggestions tailored to their goals, such as balanced meals or high-protein options.

### Cultural Insights Module
The **Cultural Insights Module** enriches the user experience by providing historical and cultural context for each recipe. This module emphasizes the importance of culinary heritage and educates users on the cultural significance behind traditional dishes.
- **Curated Cultural Content**: Each recipe includes an overview of its cultural background, explaining its origins, historical context, and significance within its originating culture. This information is sourced from both research and user submissions.
- **Storytelling Integration**: Users can read stories, anecdotes, or family histories associated with specific recipes, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of the dish. This narrative element enhances engagement and connection.
- **Dynamic Content Updates**: The Cultural Insights Module is continually updated with user-submitted stories and facts, creating a living archive of culinary traditions. Moderation ensures content quality, accuracy, and authenticity.

Together, these components create an immersive, culturally enriched cooking experience that connects users to the world’s culinary heritage. Through its blend of AI, interactive maps, and cultural storytelling, axwrld makes global recipes accessible, relevant, and deeply personal.
